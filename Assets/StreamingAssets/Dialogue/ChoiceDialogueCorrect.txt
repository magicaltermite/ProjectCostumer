Howard: “The humans did not put out the fire like they should have done”;
Barnaby: “Together we gathered the clues to solve the mystery of the wildfire. You did a really good job finding these clues!”;
Howard: “I want to explain it to you Barnaby to make sure I understand how we solved it.”; 
Howard: “We found the half burned pine cone and that showed us that the fire had spread in a specific way because of the wind.”; 
Howard: “The dry leaves showed us the same thing.”; 
Howard: “That way we knew we were going the correct way. At the end we found the campfire!”;
Barnaby: “You are indeed correct Howard! And YOU helped us solve it! Good job. Together we can prevent wildfires!”
