Howard: ”Barnaby! The fire has ruined so much of the forest already. Thank you for putting out the fire. The fire destroyed my home and injured my wing”;
Barnaby: “I need to find out what happened. I do not know what happened, do you know anything”;
Howard: “I saw some humans at a campsite somewhere here. They ran right before the fire started”;
Barnaby: “Let us see if we can find them and find out what happened”;
Howard: “Good idea! Let me help you”
